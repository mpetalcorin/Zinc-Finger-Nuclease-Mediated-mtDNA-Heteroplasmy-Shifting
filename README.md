# Zinc-Finger-Nuclease-Mediated-mtDNA-Heteroplasmy-Shifting
This project looks at a powerful tool called mtZFN (mitochondria-targeted Zinc Finger Nuclease).

# mtZFN Heteroplasmy Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that simulates and analyzes how **mtZFNs (mitochondria-targeted Zinc Finger Nucleases)** can help fix damaged mitochondrial DNA by reducing harmful mutations in cells.

## Summary

Mitochondria are tiny power plants inside our cells. They have their own DNA, and when that DNA becomes damaged, it can lead to serious diseases. But our cells usually carry a mix of both good and bad mitochondrial DNA, a condition called **heteroplasmy**.

This project explores how a gene-editing tool called **mtZFN** can help remove the bad DNA while keeping the good. The notebook provides an analysis of how well this tool works under different conditions using computer simulations.

## Project Contents

- `mtZFN_heteroplasmy_analysis.ipynb` — Main notebook with simulation and analysis
- Sample plots and visualizations showing how heteroplasmy changes over time
- Code for simulating treatment outcomes with different mtZFN strategies

## How to Use
Run the cells step by step to explore:
	•	What is heteroplasmy?
	•	How does mtZFN affect mutated mtDNA?
	•	What are the possible outcomes after treatment?

 ## Features
	•	Simulates heteroplasmy dynamics with and without mtZFN
	•	Visual plots of mutation levels over time
	•	Easy-to-understand parameter settings
	•	Expandable for other mitochondrial gene-editing tools

  ## Who Is This For?
	•	Students learning about mitochondrial DNA and gene therapy
	•	Scientists studying mitochondrial disease
	•	Bioengineers testing synthetic or gene-editing strategies
	•	Anyone curious about how we can fix damaged DNA in living cells
